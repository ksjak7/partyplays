PartyPlays is a Windows desktop application that creates virtual controllers using Vigem that can be connected to remotely by mobile devices on your local network.  Several devices can control the same controller simultaeneously, allowing any game to have any number of players.

Inspired by Chat Plays series as done by several Twitch Streamers and YouTubers, that allows viewers to control a game via text chat.

To connect: 
1. Type in the IP Address and port into your mobile browser (i.e. xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000)
2. Type the controller id for the controller you want to control and press connect (i.e. "l4H8CG" or "NJwJNc")
